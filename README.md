# remainder-algorithms
Implements three algorithms computing a number based on prime modulo values.
See Chinese Remainder Theorem for proof of solution existence. <br/>
Written for Math290 Reading in Number Theory. <br/> <br/>

Method 1 (brute force) is commented out because it is waaay too slow. <br/>
Methods 2 and 3 seem comparable for low output values.
Method 3 becomes faster than method 2 for high output values.
